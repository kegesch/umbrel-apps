tagline: Self-hosted orchestrator for AI autonomous agents
description: >-
  OpenAgent is a self-hosted cloud orchestrator for AI coding agents. Run
  Claude Code, OpenCode, and Amp in isolated Linux workspaces with full
  mission control, real-time monitoring, and git-backed configuration
  management.


  Features:

  - Dual Runtime Support: Run Claude Code, OpenCode, or Amp agents in
    the same infrastructure

  - Mission Control: Start, stop, and monitor agents remotely with
    real-time streaming

  - Git-backed Library: Manage skills, tools, rules, and agent configs
    in a single git repository

  - Web Dashboard: Modern Next.js interface with CPU/memory graphs,
    mission timeline, and agent logs

  - MCP Server Support: Optional tool servers for desktop automation
    and extended capabilities


  IMPORTANT SETUP REQUIREMENTS

  Before using OpenAgent, you must configure essential security settings:

  1. Default credentials: The app ships with placeholder credentials.
     You MUST change these before production use. Edit the environment
     variables in Umbrel's app settings:
     - DASHBOARD_PASSWORD: Set a strong password
     - JWT_SECRET: Set a long random string (generate with: openssl rand
       -base64 32)

  2. Development mode: DEV_MODE defaults to true for testing. Set to
     false in production.

  3. AI Provider: Configure your preferred AI provider (Anthropic for
     Claude, OpenAI, etc.) by setting the appropriate API key in the
     environment variables.


  FEATURES WITHOUT PRIVILEGED MODE (DEFAULT)

  The following features work without privileged mode:
  - Dashboard and web UI
  - Agent chat interface
  - File operations and code editing
  - Library management (skills, tools, rules)
  - Mission control and monitoring
  - Most agent tasks and tools


  FEATURES REQUIRING PRIVILEGED MODE (ADVANCED)

  To enable full isolated container workspaces with systemd-nspawn,
  you need to enable privileged mode. This is NOT recommended for
  production and should only be done if you understand the security
  implications:

  1. SSH into your Umbrel
  2. Edit the docker-compose.yml:
     ~/umbrel/app-data/kegesch-openagent/docker-compose.yml
  3. Uncomment the privileged: true line in the openagent service
  4. Restart the app

  WARNING: Privileged containers have full host access and can break
  Umbrel's security isolation. Only enable this on trusted, single-user
  instances.


  OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION

  - Library Git Repo: Configure a remote git repository for your
    skills and configs via the dashboard Settings page

  - TAVILY_API_KEY: Set for enhanced web search (optional, falls back
    to DuckDuckGo)

  - OPENAGENT_SECRET_PASSPHRASE: Set to encrypt stored secrets
