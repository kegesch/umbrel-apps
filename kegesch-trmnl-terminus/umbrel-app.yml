tagline: Self-hosted server for TRMNL e-ink devices
description: >-
  Terminus is a self-hosted BYOS (Bring Your Own Server) solution for TRMNL
  e-ink devices. Run your own server to manage and display content on your
  TRMNL devices without relying on external cloud services.


  Built with Ruby and Hanami, Terminus provides a dashboard for managing devices,
  playlists, and plugins. It supports auto-provisioning of devices and includes
  a JSON Data API for integration.


  SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Configure your TRMNL device via the captive WiFi portal to use
       http://umbrel.local:2300 as your custom server host
    2. Click Register to create your first account (first user gets admin access)
    3. Your device should auto-provision and appear in the dashboard


  CUSTOM API_URI CONFIGURATION

    If your devices cannot resolve umbrel.local, you can customize the API_URI:

    1. SSH into your Umbrel
    2. Edit ~/umbrel/app-data/kegesch-trmnl-terminus/settings.env
    3. Change API_URI to your Umbrel's IP (e.g., http://192.168.1.x:2300)
    4. Restart the app: sudo ~/umbrel/scripts/app restart kegesch-trmnl-terminus
