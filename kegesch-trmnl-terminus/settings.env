# API_URI - The URL your TRMNL devices use to connect to this server.
# Default: http://umbrel.local:2300

# Change this if:
# - You access your Umbrel via IP address instead of umbrel.local
# - You're using a reverse proxy or custom domain
# - Your devices can't resolve umbrel.local
#
# Examples:
#   API_URI=http://192.168.1.100:2300
#   API_URI=http://myumbrel.home:2300
#   API_URI=https://trmnl.mydomain.com
