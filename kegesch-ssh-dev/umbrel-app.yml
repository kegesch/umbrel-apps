  🗝️ SSH KEY SETUP

  To add your SSH public key for passwordless access:

  1. Copy your public key content (e.g., from ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)

  2. SSH into the container

  3. Add it to authorized_keys:
     echo "your-public-key-content" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

  4. Set correct permissions:
     chmod 700 ~/.ssh
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


  💡 USAGE EXAMPLES

  Start OpenCode in a project:
    cd ~/workspace
    opencode-ai

  Use tmux for persistent sessions:
    tmux new -s dev

  Monitor system resources:
    htop

  Edit files:
    vim filename.py
    nano filename.sh
